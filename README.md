# Exercise Tracker - Full Stack MERN Application

## About 
This single-page application (SPA) uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to track exercises completed by the user. The user can add, view, update, and delete exercises. The front-end user interface is built with React. The back-end REST API is built with Node and Express for handling data stored in MongoDB.
