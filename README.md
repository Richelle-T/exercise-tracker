# Exercise Tracker (Full Stack MERN Application)

## About 
This single-page application (SPA) uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to track exercises completed by the user. It consists of a back-end REST API built with Node and Express which accesses data from MongoDB, and a front-end user interface built with React.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application where users can record their exercise activities. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on exercises. It consists of a backend REST API built with Node.js and Express.js for handling data persistence in MongoDB. The frontend is developed using React, providing an intuitive user interface for managing exercises.


## React UI

The frontend comprises three main pages:

1. **Home Page**: Displays all exercises in a table format with options to delete or edit each exercise.
2. **Edit Exercise Page**: Allows users to edit existing exercises with pre-populated data.
3. **Create Exercise Page**: Enables users to add new exercises to the database.

## Technical Requirements

- Model code must be separate from controller code.
- Use of a `.env` file for configuring port and MongoDB connection string.
- Utilization of ES modules for the REST API.
- Function-based React components only.
- Proper CSS styling adhering to project guidelines.

## Design Features

- Semantic page layout using HTML tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>`.
- Navigation component with links to Home Page and Create Exercise Page.
- Use of `<select>` element for unit selection.
- Custom styling following project CSS guidelines.

For detailed implementation and setup instructions, please refer to the codebase and documentation. This project is intended for educational purposes and can be publicly shared as part of a portfolio.
